<u>Wave 3 and Wave 4 COVID-19 in Hong Kong - phylogenetic analysis</u>
Scenario
Wave 3 outbreak in Hong Kong was eventually controlled with painful strict control measures including banning on public gatherings with more than two persons. While there was a short peace in mid-October 2020, another surge recognized as Wave 4 undertook with the identification of super-spreading clusters. This broke the record of the longest period of persistent reports of local cases. While Wave 4 was spreading through December, in the Christmas UK strikingly reported the emergence of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant â€“ named as Alpha (B.1.1.7) later, with a much higher transmissibility than the original circulating virus. Worries have been around the potential introduction and circulation of Alpha variant in Hong Kong.
